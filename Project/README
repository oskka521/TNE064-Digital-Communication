THE PROJECT

This project is a part of the course TNE064 (Digital Communication Electronics),
6hp Linköping University. The project was chosen between several predefined options,
project 6 was selected ”VHDL simulation and implementation of image processing
Algorithms ". The algorithms selected were egde-detection (Sobel), Gaussian blur and
unsharp filter. To expand the project, it was chosen to also use a VGA driver to
be able to display the image on a VGA screen, to make the project more difficult. The structure of the project
is based on two parallel tracks; MATLAB and VHDL, where VHDL was included
MATLAB to ensure image processing. The project uses kernel
convolution where the kernel size is 3x3, this is because these operations are
relatively simple and needs some calculations.
